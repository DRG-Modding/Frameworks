# Frameworks
A place to put any files that may be used to help with certain types of modding.
 
If you would like to contribute, and are not a member of the organisation, please contact me (Buckminsterfullerene#6666) on Discord so I can send you an invite.

If you are a member of the org, please make a folder to categorise what your framework does (if one has not been made already) and add a readme inside that explains how to use it/them (if not explained elsewhere).
